# passport-local-sessionless

A simple project to demonstrate how we can implement passport-local authentication i.e. login/signup with username and password using passport-local strategy and without using session.

More branches will be created to demonstrate how can we use it with session and passport-jwt(without session) for authentication.

I hope you will learn somthing new from this.
